For Preference 1, stack one cube block on top of another, and then place both a tall rectangular block and an additional cube block on the first cube block. For Preference 2, create a stack where a cube block is on top of a tall rectangular block, which is on top of another cube block, with an additional cube block on top of the tall rectangular block, ensuring the bottom cube block is the same type as the tall rectangular block. For Preference 3, stack a tall rectangular block on top of a cube block, which is on top of another cube block, and make sure the top cube block is the same type as another cube block not involved in the stack. Your score at the end of the game is the sum of the number of times Preference 1 and Preference 2 have been satisfied (each counted once) plus the number of times Preference 3 has been

The game involves throwing dodgeballs and tan cylindrical blocks. A dodgeball scores 1 point when it stops moving and rests on the hexagonal bin, and 6 points when it stops moving and is on top of the bin. A tan cylindrical block scores 1 point when it stops moving and is inside the hexagonal bin. Your final score is the sum of these points.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference preference0<br>      (exists (?v0 - hexagonal_bin ?v1 - dodgeball)<br>

Specifically, create a stack where a bridge block is on a blue cube block, with another block on top of the bridge block, and the bridge block itself is also on a cube block. Additionally, place two cube blocks on a flat gray block, which should be on another cube block of the same type as the flat gray block. Throughout the game, hold and throw a red dodgeball, ensuring it comes to a stop. At the end of the game, your score is the sum of the following: 4 points for each stack of two cube blocks on a flat gray block that is on another cube block of the same type, 1 point for each stack involving a bridge block on a blue cube block with another block on top, and 1 point for each throw of the red dodgeball.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference

The game involves interacting with different blocks and a dodgeball. You must pick up a green triangle block, let it go for a while, then pick it up again until it stops moving to satisfy one condition. For another, hold a dodgeball, throw it so it lands and rests on the hexagonal bin. You also need to release a cube block, allowing it to move on its own and come to a stop. Additionally, pick up a cube block, let it go for a while, and then let it move on its own until it stops. Your final score is calculated by multiplying the number of times you've satisfied the conditions with the green triangle block, the cube block's autonomous movement, and the cube block's rest, then multiplying this total by 3. To this, add the number of times you've successfully thrown the dodgeball onto the hexagonal bin.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference preference0<br>

Your score at the end of the game is calculated by adding twice the product of the number of times a chair is on a desk and a pen or CD is in a bin, the number of times a dodgeball is thrown onto the bed, and the number of times the block stacking is achieved.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference preference0<br>      (exists (?v0 - chair ?v1 - desk)<br>

Additionally, by the end of the game, ensure that a yellow cube block and another cube block are both on top of a block that is adjacent to a cylindrical block. Your score at the end of the game is the sum of the number of successful throws for dodgeballs and cube blocks, as well as the number of times the specific arrangement of blocks adjacent to a cylindrical block is achieved.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference preference0<br>      (exists (?v0 - hexagonal_bin ?v1 - dodgeball)<br>        (then<br>

Your final score is calculated by adding the total number of successful golfball throws onto a hexagonal bin to 40 times the product of the number of successful throws for each of the other three

The game involves throwing different balls with the goal of landing them on specific targets. You can throw a golfball, aiming for it to rest on the hexagonal bin; throw either a basketball or a white golfball, aiming for them to land on the top drawer; throw a basketball to land on the hexagonal bin; and throw a dodgeball to also land on the hexagonal bin. Your score at the end of the game is determined by the number of successful golfball throws onto the hexagonal bin plus 40 times the sum of the number of successful throws for each of the other three
