For another, hold a dodgeball, throw it so it lands and rests on the hexagonal bin. You also need to release a cube block, allowing it to move on its own and come to a stop. Additionally, pick up a cube block, let it go for a while, and then let it move on its own until it stops. Your final score is calculated by multiplying the number of times you've satisfied the conditions with the green triangle block, the cube block's autonomous movement, and the cube block's rest, then multiplying this total by 3.
