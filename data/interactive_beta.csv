Then i settled for the Basketball game because the dodge balls gave me the least amount of trouble. ,I think my pc is too powerful for this and i think the physics are based on FPS.

At the beginning of the game you will have to build a basketball basket on the center of room. You will have few minutes to do it. You can use various items in the room like cylinderblocks to make a pipe and use a bin as a basket. But be careful, you should also take care of the safety of play (not break something).

The bin should be stable on top of the structure you have build. Player will have an extra abilities to freeze (except bin, it will be stable as long as the construction is stable) up to 3 different items. Every other usage of it will cost him 15 points.

Your goal is to achieve at least 200 points with 50 ball throwings.
Basket should be built finally at eye level when you are not crouching.","Game will be basketball, player will need to throw 3 different sized balls to it - beachball, dodgeball and basketball. They are different sized and different pointed.

Then every time he throws a ball player will be spawned in random place in the room and player will need to hit the ball into a basket.","Firstly, player will gain extra 10 points if he use pillow or dog dogbed to secure desktop screens or notebook. He loose 20 points for any extra ""freeze"".

Player needs to throw a ball to the bin without break built construction or something behind it (for example computers).

He may use any ball you want, but:
- if player score with smallest (dodge) ball you will earn 5 points;
- if player score with basketball - you will earn 7 points;
- if player score using beachball (which is too big for bin and it will be on it) - you will earn 15 points

Extra points can be achieve if the player:
- use pillows/dogbed/teddy bear to secure notebook (+10 points)
- use pillow/dogbed/teddy bear to secure dekstop (+10 points)
- use blinds to secure windows (2x 10 points)
- secure door windows (+50 points - it's diffifult to secure it), example: https://i.imgur.com/hH6ClWQ.png
- hide alarmclock in drawer (10 points)
- hide cellphone in drawer (10 points)

The fewer objects change its default position to build a basket and put it in the position of the eyes, the better.

Every time a item will be moved (except balls, opening and closing drawer and move blinds) a player will loose 5 points. That's why player gains extra points if he remember to secure room and he make the least amount of movements.
If the player broke window, notebook or ",4,70,Approximately 60 points,"I fortgot to mention that ""destroying"" window, computer or notebook will be -40 points and I destroyed desktop (I couldn't grab it buy it was on the floor).

Strength of throwing the ball was very hard, also the ball was jumping up and down more than I thought. I was playing with balls during practise but not into the bin, so my first game with throwing balls to bin was really hard. I tried to do it with various places and for many, many attempts (and broken destkop) I managed to do it with basketball.","The number of items was small and gravity works weird. I wanted to create a game where we use ramp and slide a balls on it to but them on the shelf (near the bed) but it was impossible - something like bowling. So I thought about standard basketball. I thought it will be hard with difficult gravity and moving object to create (but not as much as it was) so I wanted to reward a player with various actions like thinking how to secure room with the least amount of moving blocks. To make a game more complex, funny and fair I decided to give him ability with few extra ""freezes"". ","Rather not, except difficult gravity of items and one time one block from shelf ""exploded"" (?) when I moved it close to window. I mean probably fell off the room (bug).

Destruction system with computers, smartphone or mug was fun (now I feel confused whether I said before about mug...) but it was strange it was impossible to break window of door.

Also few times my character was trapped until until the item was moved. Jumping or walking on items may be helpful.","Nothing more, game was really fun. I wonder what the main purpose of the task was. Anyway, thanks for nice time I spent  by helping you with your research :)
Have a nice day!","No, just my brain :)",True,"scoring,difficulty,firstTimeScore"
